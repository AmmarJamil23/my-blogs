  <h1>Important DBMS Concepts Every Computer Science Student Must Know</h1>

  <p>Database Management Systems (DBMS) are software tools used to store, manage, and retrieve data. Almost every application — from banking systems to social media — relies on databases. That’s why it is important for every computer science student to understand the basics of DBMS.</p>

  <p>The most basic concept in DBMS is a <strong>database</strong> itself. A database is a collection of organized data. For example, a university may store student records in a database, including names, roll numbers, and grades.</p>

  <p><strong>Tables</strong> are used to organize data in rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents a field (like name, age, etc.). Tables are the most common structure in a relational database.</p>

  <p><strong>Primary keys</strong> are unique values that identify each record in a table. For example, a student ID can be a primary key. No two students can have the same ID.</p>

  <p><strong>Foreign keys</strong> are used to connect tables together. They refer to the primary key of another table. This helps keep the data linked and reduces duplication.</p>

  <p>DBMS also uses a language called <strong>SQL (Structured Query Language)</strong>. It is used to interact with the database — to insert, delete, update, or fetch data. For example, <code>SELECT * FROM students;</code> gets all records from the "students" table.</p>

  <p>Another key concept is <strong>Normalization</strong>. It means organizing data in such a way that there is no repetition or unnecessary data. This improves the efficiency and structure of the database. This involves breaking a big relation(table) into seperate smaller relations using 1NF, 2NF upto 5NF.</p>

  <p><strong>Transactions</strong> in DBMS refer to a group of operations that are treated as a single unit. They follow the ACID rules: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These rules ensure that data stays correct even during system crashes or other failures.</p>

  <p>Modern applications often deal with a lot of users at the same time. <strong>Concurrency control</strong> in DBMS makes sure that multiple people can use the system without affecting each other's data.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, DBMS is a core subject in computer science. It teaches how to organize and manage data efficiently, which is a valuable skill for developers, data analysts, and system architects. Learning DBMS concepts step-by-step will build a strong foundation for working with real-world data.</p>
