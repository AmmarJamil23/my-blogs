  <h1>Bank Management System – C++ Project (Terminal Based)</h1>

  <p>This project was created as part of our first semester computer programming subject. It is a terminal-based Bank Management System written in C++. The aim of the project was to simulate basic banking operations like creating accounts, depositing money, withdrawing money, and calculating zakat.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Managing customer accounts and transactions manually becomes difficult as the number of customers increases. To solve this issue, we developed a simple and user-friendly Bank Management System using C++. It can perform basic banking tasks through a text-based menu system.</p>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Allow customers to register and create new bank accounts.</li>
    <li>Enable secure deposits and withdrawals from accounts.</li>
    <li>Support for different account types like savings and checking.</li>
    <li>Calculate zakat automatically on applicable accounts.</li>
    <li>Store and display account summaries and reports.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>System Features</h2>
  <h3>1. Account Creation</h3>
  <p>Users can create new bank accounts by providing required information like name and initial deposit.</p>

  <h3>2. Deposit and Withdrawal</h3>
  <p>The system allows users to deposit or withdraw money by entering the account number and the amount.</p>

  <h3>3. Zakat Calculation</h3>
  <p>For savings accounts with a balance above a certain limit, zakat is calculated and displayed.</p>

  <h3>4. Reports</h3>
  <p>The system shows detailed account information like account number, holder name, and balance.</p>

  <h2>Functional Requirements</h2>
  <h3>Customer Management</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Create and store customer details securely.</li>
    <li>View and update customer information easily.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Account Management</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Open and close accounts.</li>
    <li>Support multiple types of accounts.</li>
    <li>Perform deposits, withdrawals, and calculate zakat.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Transaction Handling</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Update balances in real-time after every transaction.</li>
    <li>Display history of transactions if required.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Language:</strong> C++</li>
    <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Windows Terminal (Command Line)</li>
    <li><strong>IDE:</strong> Visual Studio / Code::Blocks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>System Design Overview</h2>
  <p>The project has different modules:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Create Account:</strong> Accepts user data and creates a new account.</li>
    <li><strong>Deposit:</strong> Adds money to the selected account.</li>
    <li><strong>Withdraw:</strong> Subtracts money from the selected account.</li>
    <li><strong>Report:</strong> Displays account information and balance.</li>
    <li><strong>Zakat:</strong> Calculates zakat based on account type and balance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sample Code Snippet</h2>
  <pre><code>
class BankAccount {
  string name;
  int accountNumber;
  double balance;

public:
  void createAccount() {
    cout << "Enter Name: ";
    cin >> name;
    cout << "Enter Account Number: ";
    cin >> accountNumber;
    cout << "Enter Initial Deposit: ";
    cin >> balance;
  }

  void deposit(double amount) {
    balance += amount;
  }

  void withdraw(double amount) {
    if (amount <= balance) balance -= amount;
    else cout << "Insufficient balance!";
  }

  void display() {
    cout << "Account Number: " << accountNumber << endl;
    cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
    cout << "Balance: " << balance << endl;
  }
};
  </code></pre>

  <h2>Testing and Output</h2>
  <p>The program was tested for creating accounts, performing deposits and withdrawals, and checking reports. All features worked correctly and were displayed properly in the terminal.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>This project gave us hands-on experience with C++ programming, especially with object-oriented concepts like classes, functions, and file handling. It also taught us how to structure a terminal-based application and test it for different edge cases.</p>
