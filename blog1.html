  <h1>Linux Basics for Beginners</h1>

  <p>Linux is a free and open-source operating system that is widely used in servers, computers, and even mobile devices. It is powerful, secure, and highly customizable. Most of the world's websites run on Linux-based servers, which makes it very important for computer science students to learn.</p>

  <p>One key feature of Linux is that it is command-line driven. This means you can control almost everything using text-based commands. At first, this may seem hard, but it gives you more control and helps you understand how your system works.</p>

  <p>Here are some basic Linux commands that every beginner should know:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>pwd</code> – Shows the current working directory.</li>
    <li><code>ls</code> – Lists all files and folders in the current directory.</li>
    <li><code>cd</code> – Changes the directory. For example: <code>cd Documents</code>.</li>
    <li><code>mkdir</code> – Makes a new directory. Example: <code>mkdir myfolder</code>.</li>
    <li><code>rm</code> – Removes files. Example: <code>rm file.txt</code>.</li>
    <li><code>clear</code> – Clears the terminal screen.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Another important thing to learn is how to manage permissions. In Linux, every file and folder has read, write, and execute permissions. You can check permissions using <code>ls -l</code> and change them using <code>chmod</code>. For example, <code>chmod +x script.sh</code> makes a script executable.</p>

  <p>Linux is also known for its package managers. These are tools that let you install software easily. For example, in Ubuntu (a popular Linux distro), you can install a tool using <code>sudo apt install</code>. The <code>sudo</code> command allows you to run things as an administrator (superuser).</p>

  <p>Overall, ,learning Linux is a great step for your programming and system skills. It helps you become more independent as a developer and gives you better understanding of how computers really work. Start small, and practice these commands daily to build confidence.</p>
